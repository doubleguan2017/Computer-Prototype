# NU Healthy Sports
The name of our team: Triple Helix

Our problem is to help people who suffer sports and workout injuries or other injuries that people may suffer in their lives. Specifically, we want to help people who may suffer an injury while at Northwestern University. We intend to build a support system for people to help each other when they suffer injuries. Additionally, we will create a platform for people to share experiences theyâ€™ve had while injured.  We also want to help prevent others from being injured, and to show proper warm-up routines for sports and working out.

We first designed representative tasks and UI of the website based on research on similar websites and user test, then all dynamic web pages for users to get help when they get sports injuries are developed by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; Bootstrap framework is also utilized to implement the interactive web pages.

# Essential Features of website
1. Way for students to do their self-diagnosis and get information they need following a sports injury
2. Way for students to schedule appointments with doctors or nearby health service centers (hours open, phone number, and map/address)
3. Way for students to search and share their experiences which are useful for recovery and first aid treatment for emergency injuries
