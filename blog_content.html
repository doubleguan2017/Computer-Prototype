                            <p>I just wanted to share with everyone what my experience has been on campus recovering from a broken leg
                            and see if anyone has advice to offer. It has certainly been hard getting to my classes without being able to walk at
                            full speed. I have had to allow significant extra time in getting to and from class. It has also been difficult in finding
                            and getting to a seat if the room is crowded. This initial adjustment was hard but over time has gotten easier. Does 
                            anyone have advice to share on how they managed to get around?</p>

                                how people have managed through it. I'm currently just trying to take one day at a time and believe that is the
                                best way to go about it.</p>

                                <p>I suffered a torn ACL last year and I would highly recommend communicating with your professors.
                                Mine were very understanding and aware of my circumstance which made it much easier if I was ever running late for
                                class. I would also recommend finding a chair close the door and asking students not to use it, so you won't have to 
                                struggle with climbing over everyone to find a seat.</p>
